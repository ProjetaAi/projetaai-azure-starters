# ForDevs (Starters for plugins)

This folder contains templates **for projetaai plugin developers** to create
their own starters. The files inside this folder may contain sections
like this:

```
# TODO: <description>
```

These `TODO` comments are used to tell the plugin developer what they
have to do in order to make it an usable starter.

> Remember: All starters use cookiecutter
